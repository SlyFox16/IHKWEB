General Understanding and changes.

the database has three target groups (TGs), that need to be addressed. each target group need to have a way to use the database for their own good.

TG 1: the experts

Crowd Experts (CEs) must be able to sign on and open an account as expert. After Admin has validated the information ( incl work probes, references, pic id, social media links, etc ) the expert page is live and has a certain level of experience ( levels description see below ).
CEs can then edit and extend their information, but the basic information  (name , address and level ) can only be changed by the admin and by request.


TG 2 : the seekers

Seekers can be individuals or companies that seek for experts. they can scan the experts database. to get a detailed search or a contact to the experts the seeker needs to register and confirm via email reply. All seeking requests have to logged . One reason for the log is to prove search and match success to the experts and to be able to add search extensions at a later stage.

TG 3 ; the program owners

Programm owners are companies or institutions that offer trainings for being a crowd experts. The IHK CrowdFunding manager is the first program owner and there are others to come. The program owner has its own Level grade ( for the experts that completed the training ) and its own certificate ( date / course overview ) and its own Logo of excellence


Experts and experts view

all experts can have one or several trainings completed. If an experts has no training at all he /she starts at Level 1. Depending on the level add ( ie. IH has 3 Level points ) the Level grade adds up and raises.

The same with Rankings . Rankings ( Stars ) are given by the Seekers after a job has been completed with a description of the job and a double checked ( proofed by admin ) ranking grade.

the experts detail page needs to have possibility for the expert to edit a reference ( link ) to other exiting experts databased to confirm und underline the individual competence

The expert must be able to upload and show individual certificated as pdf if proof is needed by admin
The expert detail page must show all certification logos ( all at the same preset size ) , level and ranking grade
The expert can be an expert in CrowdSourcing , CrowdFunding and CrowdInnovation. multiple choice is possible and the „expert in „ must be shown for each expert in their individual experts detail page
The expert detail page must have the option to list „multiple“ referenced and quotes of expertise - if there are more than 3 references then the references are listed by date and can be open up to show more references by click ( to have a „all look the same“ detail page, even an experts may have a lot of references )


Search and Find experts

all search should be full text and indexed enabled. Like google when stating a search ( ie by name ) the search field should preset suggestions.
when the search results are shown the search term ( ie. name ) should be marked by color or bold

detail search should be possible for the seekers ( city / field of experience / level / ranking )
